# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## 📖 Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform.  
It serves as a **hands-on learning experience** for building scalable, secure, and production-ready applications.  
This project focuses on backend development, database design, API creation, and CI/CD automation — helping learners gain practical experience with real-world systems and collaborative workflows.



## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop a **robust backend system** using Django and MySQL.  
- Design a **relational database** that supports user accounts, bookings, listings, and reviews.  
- Build **secure APIs** that handle authentication, authorization, and data transactions.  
- Integrate **GraphQL** for efficient data querying and interaction.  
- Implement **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments.  
- Containerize the application using **Docker** to ensure portability and consistency.  
- Promote **team collaboration** through structured repository management and documentation.
